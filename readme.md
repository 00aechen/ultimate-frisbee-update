An AngularJS update for the Princeton Ultimate Frisbee roster page.

Roster information is stored in json format, which makes it easy to make changes, and the view is generated using ng-repeats so that when updating the website you don't have to make any changes to the html - only add info to the json file, and change the initial starting index of the button in DefaultRosterController.
